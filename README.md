# DPU Simulator - VM and Container-based Kubernetes + OVN-Kubernetes CNI Environment

This project automates the deployment of DPU simulation environments using either **VMs (libvirt)** or **containers (Kind)**, pre-configured with Kubernetes and OVN-Kubernetes (or other CNIs) for container networking experiments/development/CI/CD.

DPUs are being used in data centers to accelerate different workloads such as AI (Artificial Intelligence), NFs (Network Functions) and many use cases. This DPU simulation's goal is to bring the DPU into developer's hands without needing the hardware. DPU hardware has limitations such as ease of provisioning, hardware availability, cost, embedded CPU capacity, and others, the DPU simulation tools here using Virtual Machines or Containers should lower the barrier of entry to move fast in developing features in Kubernetes, CNIs, APIs, etc... The second objective is to use this simulation in upstream CI/CD for CNIs that support offloading to DPUs such as OVN-Kubernetes

These are the list of DPUs that this simulation will try to emulate:
- NVIDIA BlueField 3
- Marvell Octeon 10
- Intel NetSec Accelerator
- Intel IPU

All these DPUs have common simularities, some we can emulate better than others. As this DPU simulation project grows there would a increased interest and need to simulate the hardware closely (e.g. eSwitch) in QEMU drivers.

## Status: 🚧 Active Development
 - `dpu-sim` is functional for VM & Kind mode.
 - `vmctl` is functional for managing VMs created by dpu-sim.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Fedora/RHEL/CentOS Linux
- Golang compiler
- Make
- **For VM Mode**: KVM/QEMU virtualization support, at least 12GB RAM, 100GB disk
- **For Kind Mode**: Container support, at least 8GB RAM

### Dependencies
Runtime dependencies are automatically installed by dpu-sim. For example the dpu-sim binary will output the following if all depencies are meet on the system:
```bash
=== Checking Dependencies ===
✓ Detected Linux distribution: rhel 9.6 (package manager: dnf, architecture: x86_64)
✓ wget is installed
✓ pip3 is installed
✓ jinjanator is installed
✓ git is installed
✓ openvswitch is installed
✓ libvirt is installed
✓ qemu-kvm is installed
✓ qemu-img is installed
✓ libvirt-devel is installed
✓ virt-install is installed
✓ genisoimage is installed
✓ All dependencies are available
```
Seperate dependencies are checked whether the provided configuration file is deploying VM vs. Kind modes.

### Required Packages

The dpu-sim should install all dependecies by detecting the system's Linux distribution. However some distributions require enabling subscriptions to allow the installation of some packages. This is outside the scope of dpu-sim; however depending on the distribution, dpu-sim will try to enable repositories.

### Required Services

Although dpu-sim tries to install dependencies, the user may be required to start required services. This can potentially go away once the handles these required servers in its entirety.

```bash
# Start and enable libvirt sockets
sudo systemctl start virtqemud.socket virtnetworkd.socket
sudo systemctl enable virtqemud.socket virtnetworkd.socket

# Start and enable Open vSwitch
sudo systemctl start openvswitch
sudo systemctl enable openvswitch

# Verify services are active
sudo systemctl status virtqemud.socket
sudo systemctl status virtnetworkd.socket
sudo systemctl status openvswitch

# Add user to libvirt group
sudo usermod -a -G libvirt $USER
newgrp libvirt
```

### Required SSH Key Setup

Generate SSH keys if you don't have them:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

### Compiling Binaries

In order to use the dpu-sim binary, the binaries must be built. To compile the GO binaries, golang compilers must be installed.

```bash
$ go version
go version go1.25.3 (Red Hat 1.25.3-1.el9_7) linux/amd64
$ make build
Building binaries...
  Building dpu-sim...
  Building vmctl...
Build complete! Binaries are in bin/
$ ls -lh bin/

-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 33M Feb 18 23:45 vmctl
```
### Makefile Commands

```bash
make                # Show help
make build          # Build all binaries
make test           # Run tests
make test-coverage  # Run tests with HTML coverage report

make deps           # Download dependencies
```

## Configuration

The simulator supports two deployment modes, configured via different sections in the YAML config file:

- **VM Mode**: Uses `vms` section (libvirt-based VMs)
- **Kind Mode**: Uses `kind` section (Docker containers)

### Kind Mode Configuration (config-kind.yaml)

Kind mode supports **two clusters** (host and DPU), similar to the VM approach. One Kind cluster is created per entry in `kubernetes.clusters`. Each node must specify which cluster it belongs to and is identified by a **node label** (`dpu-sim.org/node-name`) because Kind does not support renaming nodes.

**Node fields:**

| Field         | Required | Description |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| `name`        | Yes      | Logical node name; applied as label `dpu-sim.org/node-name` on the Kind node. |
| `k8s_cluster` | Yes      | Cluster name from `kubernetes.clusters` this node belongs to. |
| `k8s_role`    | Yes      | `control-plane` or `worker`. |
| `type`        | No       | For workers: `host` (host side) or `dpu` (DPU side). Omit for control-plane. |
| `host`        | Yes*     | For `type: dpu` only: `name` of the `host` node this DPU is paired with. |

Example with two clusters (host cluster and DPU cluster) and two host–DPU pairs:

```yaml
kind:
  nodes:
    - name: "control-plane-host"
      k8s_role: "control-plane"
      k8s_cluster: "dpu-sim-host-kind"
    - name: "control-plane-dpu"
      k8s_role: "control-plane"
      k8s_cluster: "dpu-sim-dpu-kind"
    - name: "host-1-1"
      type: host
      k8s_role: "worker"
      k8s_cluster: "dpu-sim-host-kind"
    - name: "dpu-1-1"
      type: dpu
      k8s_role: "worker"
      k8s_cluster: "dpu-sim-dpu-kind"
      host: "host-1-1"
    - name: "host-2-1"
      type: host
      k8s_role: "worker"
      k8s_cluster: "dpu-sim-host-kind"
    - name: "dpu-2-1"
      type: dpu
      k8s_role: "worker"
      k8s_cluster: "dpu-sim-dpu-kind"
      host: "host-2-1"

kubernetes:
  version: "1.33"
  clusters:
    - name: "dpu-sim-host-kind"
      pod_cidr: "10.244.0.0/16"
      service_cidr: "10.245.0.0/16"
      cni: "ovn-kubernetes"
    - name: "dpu-sim-dpu-kind"
      pod_cidr: "10.246.0.0/16"
      service_cidr: "10.247.0.0/16"
      cni: "ovn-kubernetes"
```

To look up a node by its config name after deployment, use the label: `kubectl get nodes -l dpu-sim.org/node-name=host-1-1`.

### VM Mode Configuration (config.yaml)

Edit `config.yaml` to customize your deployment:

```yaml
networks:
  # Management network with internet access
  - name: "mgmt-network"
    type: "mgmt"
    bridge_name: "virbr-mgmt"

### Network Types

Network types change the behaviour of dpu-sim on how they treat the network. For example "k8s" network shouldn't be used to access machines, rather the "mgmt" network should be used (more stable/non-changing)

- **`mgmt`**: A non-changing network to provide SSH access to the machine
- **`k8s`**: A network that the CNI would have access to. For example OVN-Kubernetes would have control of this network and it's interfaces.
- **`layer2`**: A network that is layer 2 connection between 2 machines. Currently dpu-sim does not modify this network beyond configuring it.

### Network Modes

- **`nat`**: VMs can communicate with each other AND access the internet via NAT (requires gateway, subnet_mask, dhcp_start, dhcp_end)
- **`l2-bridge`**: Pure Layer 2 bridge - VMs connected like a switch, no IP/DHCP management (configure IPs manually in VMs)
  - Set `use_ovs: true` to use Open vSwitch instead of Linux bridge
  - OVS provides: OpenFlow support, flow tables, VLAN tagging, port mirroring, QoS, and more

### Network Attachment

The `attach_to` field controls which VM types a network should attach to:

- **`any`** (default): Attach to all VMs regardless of type
- **`host`**: Only attach to VMs with `type: host`
- **`dpu`**: Only attach to VMs with `type: dpu`

Example use case: You might want a management network attached to all VMs, but a specific data plane network only attached to DPU VMs.

### NIC Models

- **`virtio`**: High-performance paravirtualized NIC (recommended for management)
- **`igb`**: Intel 82576 Gigabit Ethernet emulation (good for testing Intel drivers)
- **`e1000`**: Intel PRO/1000 emulation (widely compatible)
- **`e1000e`**: Intel 82574 emulation (newer than e1000)
- **`rtl8139`**: Realtek 8139 emulation

### VM Architecture

All VMs use the **Q35 machine type** which provides:
- **PCIe bus**
- **IOMMU support** (Intel VT-d emulation)
- **SR-IOV ready** architecture

This makes the VMs suitable for:
- Testing SR-IOV devices
- DPU emulation by interconnecting VMs with networks (OvS or Linux Bridge)
- Testing Kubernetes features with emulating hardware

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes is the choice for orchestrating DPU deployment. Hence kubernetes installation and usage is assumed. Although you might choose to simulate DPUs without Kubernetes, which currently means to pass the `--skip-k8s` flag to dpu-sim.

If Kubernetes is needed then by default dpu-sim will perform those operations automatically.

Each VM must specify which cluster it belongs to using the `k8s_cluster` field, which references a cluster name defined in the `kubernetes.clusters` section.

Each VM in `config.yaml` must have a `k8s_role` field with two supported values:
- **master**: Kubernetes control plane node
- **worker**: Kubernetes worker node

Everything Kubernetes related is in the `kubernetes` section. By default version `1.33 Kubernetes` is used however this can be overwritten in the `kubernetes.version` field. The resulting config files are generated and written into the kubeconfig directory by default, but this can be overwritten with `kubeconfig_dir`. Each cluster definition includes:
- **name**: Unique identifier for the cluster
- **pod_cidr**: Default is 10.244.0.0/16. This is the custom pod network CIDR
- **service_cidr**: Default is 10.245.0.0/16. This is the custom service CIDR.
- **cni**: Selects which CNI should be used in the cluster such as ovn-kubernetes

Multiple cluster configuration example:
```yaml
kubernetes:
  version: "1.33"
  kubeconfig_dir: "kubeconfig"
  clusters:
    - name: "cluster-1"
      pod_cidr: "10.244.0.0/16" # First cluster pod network
      service_cidr: "10.245.0.0/16"
      cni: "ovn-kubernetes"
    - name: "cluster-2"
      pod_cidr: "10.246.0.0/16" # Second cluster pod network
      service_cidr: "10.247.0.0/16"
      cni: "ovn-kubernetes"

vms:
  - name: "master-1"
    k8s_cluster: "cluster-1"
    k8s_role: "master"
    ...

  - name: "master-2"
    k8s_cluster: "cluster-2"
    k8s_role: "master"
    ...

  - name: "host-1"
    k8s_cluster: "cluster-1"
    k8s_role: "worker"
    ...

  - name: "dpu-1"
    k8s_cluster: "cluster-2"
    k8s_role: "worker"
    ...
```

### Local Registry and CNI Image Builds

When developing or testing CNI changes, you can configure dpu-sim to build CNI container images from source and serve them through a local Docker registry. This works for both VM and Kind deployment modes.

#### Configuration

Add a `registry` section to your config file:

```yaml
registry:
  containers:
    - name: "ovn-kube"
      cni: "ovn-kubernetes"
      tag: "ovn-kube:dpu-sim"
```

Each entry under `containers` defines an image to build:
- **name**: Human-readable identifier for the build
- **cni**: Which CNI's source code to compile (currently `ovn-kubernetes` is supported)
- **tag**: The `name:tag` used when pushing to the local registry (e.g. `ovn-kube:dpu-sim`)

#### How It Works

When a `registry` section is present, dpu-sim automatically:

1. **Starts a local Docker registry** (`registry:2`) on port 5000
2. **Builds the CNI image from source** using the OVN-Kubernetes git submodule
3. **Pushes the image** to the local registry
4. **Configures nodes to pull from the registry**:
   - **Kind mode**: Containerd on each node is configured to redirect `localhost:5000` pulls to the registry container on the Docker network
   - **VM mode**: CRI-O on each VM is configured to pull from the host's management network gateway IP (e.g. `192.168.120.1:5000`) over HTTP
5. **Uses the registry image** in CNI daemonset manifests instead of the upstream image from `ghcr.io`

#### Rebuilding and Redeploying CNI Images

After making changes to the CNI source code, you can rebuild and redeploy without tearing down the entire environment:

```bash
# Rebuild the CNI image and push to the local registry
$ ./bin/dpu-sim --rebuild-cni

# Rebuild AND rolling-restart CNI pods on all clusters
$ ./bin/dpu-sim --rebuild-cni --redeploy-cni
```

The `--rebuild-cni` flag requires a `registry` section in the config. It builds all configured container images and pushes them to the registry. Adding `--redeploy-cni` triggers a rolling restart of the CNI daemonsets so pods pick up the new image.

#### OVN-Kubernetes Source

The OVN-Kubernetes source code is included as a git submodule under `ovn-kubernetes/`. If the submodule is not initialized, dpu-sim will automatically initialize it during the build. To work on OVN-Kubernetes changes:

```bash
# Initialize the submodule (if not already done)
git submodule update --init ovn-kubernetes

# Make changes in ovn-kubernetes/
cd ovn-kubernetes
# ... edit code ...

# Rebuild and redeploy
cd ..
./bin/dpu-sim --rebuild-cni --redeploy-cni
```

### Using Different Cloud Image Versions

Update the `operating_system.image_url` in `config.yaml` to point to a different Cloud image:

For Fedora visit the downloads website https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/ and pick the version that is required.

```yaml
operating_system:
  # Download from https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/
  image_url: https://mirror.xenyth.net/fedora/linux/releases/43/Cloud/x86_64/images/Fedora-Cloud-Base-Generic-43-1.6.x86_64.qcow2
  image_name: "Fedora-x86_64.qcow2"
```

## Usage

The `dpu-sim` executable automatically detects whether to use VM or Kind mode based on your config file.

### Deployment Options

```bash
# Auto-detect mode from default config (default: config.yaml = VM mode)
$ ./bin/dpu-sim

# Use Kind mode explicitly
$ ./bin/dpu-sim --config config-kind.yaml

# Skip cleanup (for incremental changes)
$ ./bin/dpu-sim --skip-cleanup

# Cleanup only
$ ./bin/dpu-sim --cleanup

# Review all avaialable options
$ ./bin/dpu-sim --help
DPU Simulator automates deployment of DPU simulation environments
using either VMs (libvirt) or containers (Kind), pre-configured with
Kubernetes and CNI for container networking experiments.

This is the main orchestrator that runs the complete deployment workflow:
  1. Install dependencies
  2. Clean up existing resources (Idempotent deployment - can be run multiple times safely)
  3. Deploy infrastructure (VMs or Kind clusters)
  4. Install Kubernetes and CNI components

Usage:
  dpu-sim [flags]

Flags:
      --cleanup            Only cleanup existing resources, do not deploy
      --config string      Path to configuration file (default "config.yaml")
  -h, --help               help for dpu-sim
      --log-level string   Log level (error, warn, info, debug) (default "info")
      --skip-cleanup       Skip cleanup of existing resources
      --skip-deploy        Skip VM/Kind deployment
      --skip-deps          Skip dependency checks
      --skip-k8s           Skip Kubernetes (VM only) and CNI installation

# After deployment, use the cluster
$ export KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig/cluster-1.kubeconfig
$ kubectl get nodes
$ kubectl get pods -A
```

### VM/Kind Mode Usage

#### Step 1: Ensuring dpu-sim is compiled

Binaries are located by default in `bin`. Make sure dpu-sim compiles sucessfully with the go compiler.

#### Step 2a: Deploy (VM)

Deploy all Host and DPU VMs and the network:

```bash

╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║         Deployment Completed Successfully!    ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════╝

✓ VM deployment complete!

Your DPU simulation environment is ready:
  • VMs are running and accessible
  • Kubernetes is installed and configured
  • CNI is deployed and ready

Useful commands:
  vmctl list                    # List all VMs
  vmctl ssh <vm-name>           # SSH into a VM
  kubectl --kubeconfig kubeconfig/<cluster>.kubeconfig get nodes

Kubeconfig files: kubeconfig
For more information, see README.md
```

This will:
1. **Clean up any existing VMs and networks** (idempotent deployment - can be run multiple times safely)
2. Download Cloud Base image (if not present) - We recommend to download from Fedora.
3. Create custom libvirt networks. All Host and DPUs will have a dedicated connection between them to simulate a DPU's general design.
4. Create and start all Host and DPU VMs with cloud-init configuration
5. Wait for VMs to boot and get IP addresses
6. Kubernetes gets installed on all VMs.
  a. Disable swap (required for Kubernetes)
  b. Configure kernel modules (overlay, br_netfilter)
  c. Install and configure CRI-O
  d. Install Open vSwitch
  e. Installs Kubernetes components (`kubeadm`, `kubelet`, `kubectl`)
  f. Disable the firewall
7. One master is chosen to bootstrap the cluster with `kubeadm`
  a. Additional masters also join the cluster
8. All workers join the cluster with `kubeadm`
7. CNI gets installed on the cluster.
9. Workload pods can now be deployed on the cluster once `dpu-sim` runs to completion sucessfully.

**Note:** The `dpu-sim` application is idempotent by default - it automatically cleans up existing resources before deploying. You can run it multiple times safely. If you want to skip cleanup for some reason, use `dpu-sim --skip-cleanup`

#### Step 2b: Deploy (Kind)

#### Key Features

- **Automatic Cluster Initialization**: No manual `kubeadm` commands needed
- **Multiple Cluster Support**: Deploy multiple independent K8s clusters in one configuration
- **Custom Pod Network CIDRs**: Each cluster can have its own pod and/or service network CIDR
- **Automatic CNI Installation**: Flannel or OVN-Kubernetes is automatically installed and configured
- **Role-Based Assignment**: VMs/Kind containers are assigned as `master` or `worker` nodes
- **Network Isolation**: Different clusters use different overlay networks

After Installation finished, you should expect these software packages to be running:
- CRI-O container runtime
- `kubelet` (Kubernetes node agent)
- Flannel and other containers are running, for example:
```bash

#### Kuberenetes Use Cases with DPU Simulation

With cluster support, you can:

1. **DPU workloads**: Deploy workloads to test DPU offloading
2. **Open vSwitch**: Configure OVS bridges for data plane traffic
3. **Testing**: Test the deployment of DPU-accelerated services

With the multi-cluster support, you can:

1. **Multi-Tenancy Scenarios**: Simulate multiple independent Kubernetes environments
2. **DPU Testing**: Test DPU nodes in either single or dual cluster deployments
3. **Cross-Cluster Communication**: Experiment with DPU Operator orchestration like https://github.com/openshift/dpu-operator which uses OPI APIs

#### Verify Cluster Setup

After installation completes, verify your cluster(s):

#### Single Cluster

```bash
# Check node status
$ export KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig/cluster-1.kubeconfig
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME       STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
dpu-1      Ready    <none>          13m   v1.33.6
host-1     Ready    <none>          13m   v1.33.6
master-1   Ready    control-plane   13m   v1.33.6

# Check all pods
$ kubectl get pods -A
...

# Check Flannel CNI
$ kubectl get pods -n kube-flannel

# Or check OVN-Kubernetes CNI
$ kubectl get pods -n ovn-kubernetes

...
```

#### Multiple Clusters

```bash
# Check cluster-1
$ export KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig/cluster-1.kubeconfig
$ kubectl get nodes

# Check cluster-2
$ export KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig/cluster-2.kubeconfig
$ kubectl get nodes

# Verify different pod CIDRs
$ export KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig/cluster-1.kubeconfig
$ kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath="{.items[0].spec.podCIDR}"

$ export KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig/cluster-1.kubeconfig
$ kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath="{.items[0].spec.podCIDR}"
```

```

**Warning:** This will permanently delete all VMs and their disks.

**Note:** The `dpu-sim` application automatically cleans up before deploying, so you typically don't need to run cleanup manually unless you just want to remove everything without redeploying.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Each package has unit tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific package
go test ./pkg/config/

# Run with coverage
go test -cover ./pkg/config/
```

## Troubleshooting

### VMs not getting IP addresses

Wait 1-2 minutes for VMs to boot. Check VM status:
```bash
$ ./bin/vmctl list
VM Name              State           IP Address      vCPUs    Memory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
master-1             Running         192.168.120.74  2        4096MB
host-1               Running         192.168.120.66  2        2048MB
dpu-1                Running         192.168.120.69  2        2048MB
```

### Cannot connect via SSH

1. Verify VM is running: `./bin/vmctl list`
2. Check VM has IP address
3. Try SSH access: `./bin/vmctl ssh host-1`
4. Verify SSH key exists: `ls -la ~/.ssh/id_rsa*`

### Permission denied errors

Make sure your user is in the `libvirt` group:
```bash
groups | grep libvirt
```

If not, add yourself and log out/in:
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G libvirt $USER
```

### Cannot download cloud image

The download may take time depending on your connection. If it fails:
1. Check internet connectivity
2. Verify the image URL in `config.yaml` is correct
3. Manually download to `/var/lib/libvirt/images/`

### View Cluster Logs

```bash
# Check kubelet logs on any node
./bin/vmctl exec <vm-name> 'sudo journalctl -u kubelet -n 50'

# Check kubeadm init logs on master
./bin/vmctl exec <vm-master-name> 'cat /tmp/kubeadm-init.log'
```

## Open vSwitch Usage

### OVS Data Bridge (on Host system)

If you configured a network with `use_ovs: true`, an OVS bridge is created on the host system that connects all VMs:

```bash
# Check OVS bridge status on host
sudo ovs-vsctl show

# View the data bridge
sudo ovs-vsctl list-br

# Show all ports on the bridge
sudo ovs-vsctl list-ports ovs-data

# View OpenFlow rules
sudo ovs-ofctl dump-flows ovs-data

# Add OpenFlow rules (example: drop all traffic)
sudo ovs-ofctl add-flow ovs-data priority=100,actions=drop

# Delete all flows
sudo ovs-ofctl del-flows ovs-data

# Enable port mirroring (mirror eth1 traffic to eth2)
sudo ovs-vsctl -- set Bridge ovs-data mirrors=@m \
  -- --id=@eth1 get Port eth1 \
  -- --id=@eth2 get Port eth2 \
  -- --id=@m create Mirror name=mirror0 select-all=true output-port=@eth2
```

### OVS Inside VMs

Each VM also has OVS installed for custom networking inside the VM:

```bash
# SSH into any VM
./bin/vmctl ssh host-1

# Check OVS status
sudo ovs-vsctl show

# Create a bridge
sudo ovs-vsctl add-br br0

# List bridges
sudo ovs-vsctl list-br

# Add a port
sudo ovs-vsctl add-port br0 eth1
```
